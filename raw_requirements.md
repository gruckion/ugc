TLDR: Full concept that keeps all the good bits of Fiverr and fixes all the annoying bits

<concept-overview>
UGC Creator App – Full Concept Overview

What the app is

A UGC-first marketplace built around trust, escrow, and real-world workflow, designed specifically to fix the problems creators and brands experience on Fiverr.

It removes the financial and operational incentives to work off-platform by making the platform the safest, easiest place to work.

⸻

Core business model

Brands subscribe to post briefs.
Creators join for free.

Creators only pay a commission after their video is approved by the brand.
There are no upfront creator fees and no brand fee uplift at checkout.

Payment is held in escrow as soon as an order is booked, so creators never chase invoices and brands never pay for undelivered work.

⸻

Brand accounts and identity

A brand is treated as a single entity, not an email address. Linked vis their social media logins and domain name.

Brands can have multiple users under one brand account.
All users share the same brand history.

Reviews, disputes, and behavioural integrity attach to the brand itself, preventing brands from opening new accounts to escape poor feedback.

Creators can see a brand’s:
Overall rating
Completed job count
Dispute rate
Average approval time
Payment integrity

This protects creators from unreliable or bad-faith brands.

⸻

Brief creation

Brands create a structured brief including:
Product details and USP
Target audience and messaging angle
Deliverables and formats
Usage rights (organic or paid, platforms, duration)
Budget and deadlines
Whether a physical product is required

⸻

AI script generation (pre-creator)

Once the brief is submitted, the app generates:
AIDA scripts in multiple lengths
Hook options
CTA options
Shot lists and b-roll prompts
On-screen text suggestions
Compliance prompts

Brands review, edit, and approve the script before it is shared with creators.
Once approved, the script is locked and becomes the delivery reference.

⸻

Creator sourcing

Brands can:
Invite matched creators
Open briefs to the marketplace
Run invite-only briefs

Creators apply knowing:
Exact deliverables
Exact usage rights
Exact payout
Payment is already secured in escrow

⸻

Payments and escrow

When a creator is booked:
The brand pays the full amount immediately
Funds are held securely in escrow
Work does not begin until payment is secured

Creators see a clear “Payment secured” status on the order.

Once the final video is approved:
Platform commission is deducted
The remaining balance is released to the creator
Creators withdraw funds at their convenience

If a brand does not respond after final submission, auto-approval triggers after a set window and payment is released.

⸻

Product-based jobs and timelines

For jobs requiring physical products:
Brands must enter shipping and tracking details

The job timeline does not start until delivery is confirmed by tracking or creator confirmation.

This removes extension requests caused by courier delays and keeps timelines fair for both sides.

⸻

Order workflow

Orders move through clear, enforced states:
Awaiting Product Delivery
In Production
Submitted
Revision Requested
Approved
Completed

Deadlines only run once work can realistically begin.

⸻

Revisions

Revisions are:
Limited
Scoped
Tracked

Brands cannot endlessly tweak.
Creators cannot refuse valid, in-scope fixes.

All revision requests are logged and visible.

⸻

AI-generated content (separate lane)

AI-generated videos are a platform service between the brand and the app.

AI output:
Is created independently
Does not reuse, transform, or repurpose creator-delivered work
Does not use creator likeness, voice, or submissions

Brands can choose:
Human creator delivery
AI-generated delivery
Or both, as separate products

Creators’ work is never repurposed for free or quietly extended via AI.

⸻

Gamification, trust signals, and reputation

The platform includes a professional, behaviour-based gamification layer designed to reward integrity and reliability, not volume or popularity.

Gamification is used to surface trust, not create noise.

⸻

Reliability & integrity scores

Both brands and creators have a score that updates automatically based on behaviour.

Brand integrity factors include:
On-time approvals
Post-approval payment integrity (no chargebacks or clawbacks)
Dispute rate
Product delivery accuracy
Revision behaviour

Creator reliability factors include:
On-time delivery
Script adherence
Revision success rate
Communication responsiveness
Approval rate

These scores are visible and help both sides assess risk before accepting work.

⸻

Experience levels

Brands and creators progress through experience levels based on completed work and consistency over time.

Levels indicate trust maturity, not earnings or popularity.

Higher levels unlock:
Greater visibility
Eligibility for auto-accept
Priority matching
Optional commission or fee advantages

Levels are earned slowly and lost slowly to prevent gaming.

⸻

Trust badges

Badges highlight specific, provable behaviours.

Creator examples:
On-Time Pro
Ad-Ready
Fast Turnaround
Low Revision Rate

Brand examples:
High Integrity
Clear Briefs
Low Revision Requests
Product Delivered On Time

Badges are automatic, behaviour-based, and revocable.

⸻

Auto-accept for trusted brands and creators

Auto-accept is an optional brand-controlled feature that allows trusted creators to be accepted automatically without manual review.

Brands can enable auto-accept and define criteria such as:
Minimum creator level
Minimum reliability score
Required badges
Previous successful work with the brand
No active disputes

When a creator meets all criteria:
The order is accepted automatically
Payment is taken into escrow immediately
The job starts without delay

If criteria are not met, the application waits for manual approval.

Auto-accept:
Is never first-come-first-served
Is never visible as a “race”
Cannot trigger unless payment, script approval, and scope are locked

This rewards high-trust creators with faster starts and reduces admin for professional brands.

⸻

Why brands stay on the platform

Leaving the platform means losing:
Escrow protection
Script approvals
Usage tracking
Product-based timelines
Team access
Dispute resolution
Reliable creator history
Auto-accept and trust benefits

There is no economic or operational incentive to go off-platform.

⸻

Why creators stay on the platform

Creators get:
Guaranteed payment
Clear scope
Locked usage rights
Fair timelines
Visible brand history
No upfront fees
No chasing payments
Trust-based progression

This removes risk and restores confidence.

⸻

Admin safeguards

Admins can:
Resolve disputes
Link duplicate brand entities
Merge brand histories where abuse is detected
Enforce delivery, payment, and trust rules

Governance is quiet, consistent, and preventative.

⸻

One-line summary

A UGC platform where scripts are approved before filming, payments are secured upfront, timelines only start after product delivery, integrity is earned and visible, auto-accept rewards reliability, and AI exists as a separate, ethical service.

</concept-overview>

<unique-selling-proposition>
UGC APP USP

This app isn’t just a marketplace for UGC creators.
It’s a workflow engine that removes the friction, guesswork, and time consuming back-and-forth that normally sits between brands and creators.

Instead of connecting people and hoping they figure it out, the platform forces clarity before creation.

⸻

For brands

Most of the time in UGC is wasted before filming even starts.
Brands search endlessly for reliable creators.
Briefs are vague, scripts are unfinished, deliverables change mid-way, and creators are contacted before the job is ready.

This app flips that process.

Brands are guided step by step to:
Define their message
Approve a script
Lock deliverables and usage
Secure payment

Only then can they reach out to creators.

This means brands can source high-quality, reliable creators at scale, without endless messages, rewrites, or hand-holding.

Experienced brands move faster.
New brands are guided through best practice instead of guessing.

⸻

For creators

Creators usually lose time explaining UGC to inexperienced brands, rewriting scripts, chasing clarity and deliveries, and worrying about payment.

On this platform, that doesn’t happen.

Creators cannot be contacted until:
The script is approved
Deliverables are defined
Usage is locked
Payment is secured

Every brief is execution-ready.

Creators don’t pitch ideas or educate brands.
They execute clearly defined work, get paid automatically, and move on.

⸻

What makes this different

This app doesn’t optimise for discovery.
It optimises for execution.

It replaces conversations with structure, and trust with systems.

Scripts are approved before filming.
Payments are secured before work begins.
Timelines only start after product delivery.
Brand trust can’t be reset with a new email address.
Ad usage is verifiable, not assumed.

The platform does the thinking so people can do the work.

⸻

Who it’s for

Brands that want consistent UGC at scale without chaos.
New brands that want guidance without being taught by creators.
Creators who want clarity, protection, and guaranteed payment.

⸻

One-line USP

Trusted UGC without the back-and-forth.

Or, slightly longer:

A UGC platform where briefs are finished before creators are contacted, payments are secured upfront, and trust is enforced by the system, not the people.
</unique-selling-proposition>

<user-flows>

<brand-user-flow>
Does this work for a User Flow?

Brand user flow (USP-aligned, end to end)

1. Entry and expectation setting

Brand lands on the platform.

The messaging is clear from the first screen:
This is not a creator directory.
Creators cannot be contacted until briefs are ready.
The platform guides you to success, even if you’re new to UGC.

Primary CTA: Create Brand Account

The brand understands immediately that this is a process-led system, not DM chaos.

⸻

2. Brand account creation (entity-first)

Brand creates an account and, in doing so, creates a Brand Entity.

They enter:
Brand name
Primary contact email
Password

This brand entity becomes permanent and will hold:
Trust and integrity history
Reviews
Dispute records

They are not creating “just a login”. They are establishing an identity.

⸻

3. Subscription selection

Brand selects a subscription tier based on how many briefs they want to run.

They see clearly:
Creators join free
Creators are paid from escrow
No checkout fee uplift

A payment method is added and verified.

Nothing can be posted without this step. This filters unserious brands early.

⸻

4. Onboarding and verification (trust foundation)

Brand completes a short onboarding flow.

They are prompted to:
Add website or domain
Upload logo
Invite team members (optional)

They are then encouraged to connect:
Official social media accounts
Relevant ad accounts

Connecting accounts:
Unlocks Verified Brand status
Enables ad usage compliance
Improves creator trust and response rate

This is positioned as a benefit, not a requirement, but serious brands quickly see the value.

⸻

5. Brand dashboard (control centre)

Brand lands on their dashboard.

They see:
Active briefs
Orders in progress
Orders awaiting approval
Brand trust level and integrity status

The dominant action is always:
Create New Brief

This reinforces that the system starts with thinking first, not messaging creators.

⸻

6. Create a brief (guided, not freeform)

Brand starts a new brief and is guided through a structured flow.

They define:
Product and USP
Target audience
Messaging angle
Desired outcome
Deliverables (length, format, platform)
Usage rights (organic or paid, platforms, duration)
Budget
Deadline
Whether a physical product is required

The platform does not allow vague inputs.
This is where new brands are quietly educated.

⸻

7. AI script generation (the gatekeeper step)

Once the brief is submitted, the platform generates:

AIDA scripts in multiple lengths
Hook options
CTA options
Shot lists and b-roll prompts
On-screen text suggestions
Compliance prompts

Brand enters the Script Approval stage.

They can:
Edit wording
Regenerate sections
Choose and approve a final script

Until a script is approved:
No creators can be contacted
No applications can be received

This is the core rule that removes back-and-forth.

⸻

8. Script approval and lock

Brand approves the final script.

At this moment:
The script is locked
Deliverables are locked
Usage is locked

This becomes the execution reference.

Any changes after this require a paid amendment, not casual requests.

⸻

9. Creator sourcing

Only now does creator sourcing unlock.

Brand chooses:
Invite matched creators
Open the brief to the marketplace
Invite-only brief

If auto-accept is enabled, the brand sets criteria:
Minimum creator level
Minimum reliability score
Required badges
No active disputes

The brief is now live and execution-ready.

⸻

10. Creator selection or auto-accept

Two paths exist:

Manual selection:
Brand reviews creator profiles
Sees trust levels, badges, and history
Accepts chosen creator(s)

Auto-accept:
Trusted creators meeting criteria are accepted automatically
No waiting, no admin

In both cases, acceptance triggers payment.

⸻

11. Booking and escrow

Once a creator is accepted:
Full payment is taken immediately
Funds are held in escrow
Order status becomes Active

Brand sees:
Payment secured
Scope locked
Timeline visible

No work starts without this step completed.

⸻

12. Product shipping (if required)

If the job requires a physical product:
Brand enters courier and tracking details

Order status becomes:
Awaiting Product Delivery

The timeline does not start until delivery is confirmed.

This prevents extensions and arguments later.

⸻

13. In-production phase

Once delivery is confirmed:
Order moves to In Production
The delivery countdown begins

Brand can:
Answer clarification questions
Upload assets
Monitor progress

They cannot:
Change the script
Expand scope without paying

This keeps production calm and predictable.

⸻

14. Submission and review

Creator submits the final deliverables.

Brand can:
Approve
Request revisions (within scope and limits)

All revision requests are tracked and visible.

⸻

15. Approval, payout, and auto-approval

When brand approves:
Funds are released from escrow
Platform commission is deducted
Creator is paid

If the brand does nothing:
Auto-approval triggers after the response window
Payment is released automatically

Silence cannot be used as leverage.

⸻

16. Usage compliance and monitoring

If paid usage was included:
Connected ad accounts allow the platform to verify:
Platform usage
Duration
Compliance

If usage exceeds scope:
Brand is notified
Option to extend usage and pay

This happens without creator confrontation.

⸻

17. Completion and trust progression

Order is marked complete.

Brand:
Leaves a review
Earns integrity and experience points
Progresses trust level

Higher trust unlocks:
Better creators
Auto-accept eligibility
Faster future workflows

⸻

18. Repeat usage (where the value compounds)

Brand returns to dashboard.

They now have:
Saved scripts
Saved creators
Higher trust
Less friction

Each new brief takes less time to launch than the last.

⸻

Brand flow in one sentence

Create brand → think once → approve script → lock scope → book creator → escrow secures payment → production runs cleanly → trust compounds.
</brand-user-flow>

<creator-user-flow>
Creator user flow (clarity-first, end to end)

1. Entry and expectation setting

Creator lands on the platform.

The messaging is immediately clear:
This is not a bidding marketplace.
You won't be contacted until briefs are ready.
Payment is secured before you start work.

Primary CTA: Create Creator Account

Creators understand straight away that this platform respects their time.

⸻

2. Creator account creation (free, no friction)

Creator signs up for free.

They enter:
Name
Email
Password

No payment details required at this stage.
No subscription.
No pressure.

This removes the biggest mental barrier to joining.

⸻

3. Creator profile setup (signal, not fluff)

Creator builds a profile designed to surface reliability, not hype.

They add:
Niches and industries
Content styles (talking head, VO, demo, lifestyle)
Languages and accent
Typical turnaround time
Gear and filming setup (optional)
Portfolio links or uploads

This information powers matching.
Creators are not judged on follower count.

⸻

Creators are encouraged to complete trust steps:
Identity verification
Location confirmation (for product shipping)

These unlock:
Higher trust visibility
Eligibility for higher-value briefs

Again, positioned as a benefit, not a requirement.

⸻

5. Creator dashboard (signal over noise)

Creator lands on their dashboard.

They see:
Matched briefs
Active orders
Orders awaiting feedback
Reliability score and level
Upcoming deadlines

No spam feed.
No endless scrolling.

Everything visible is actionable.

⸻

6. Brief discovery (execution-ready only)

Creators see briefs they are matched to or invited into.

Every brief they can view already has:
An approved script
Locked deliverables
Defined usage rights
A secured budget

There are no speculative messages.
No “let’s discuss”.

Creators can:
Apply with a short confirmation
Accept an invite
Or ignore the brief

No long pitches required.

⸻

7. Applying or being auto-accepted

Two clean paths:

Manual application:
Creator applies
Brand reviews and accepts

Auto-accept:
Creator meets brand’s trust criteria
Order starts instantly
Payment is secured automatically

In both cases, creators see:
Exact payout
Commission breakdown
Timeline start conditions

Nothing is hidden.

⸻

8. Order confirmation and protection

Once accepted:
Order status becomes Active
Payment shows as secured in escrow

Creator sees a clear indicator:
“Payment secured”

This removes anxiety before filming begins.

⸻

9. Product delivery (if required)

If a physical product is involved:
Creator sees shipping and tracking details

Order status shows:
Awaiting Product Delivery

The delivery countdown does not start until:
Tracking confirms delivery
Or the creator confirms receipt

Creators are never penalised for courier delays.

⸻

10. In-production phase

Once delivery is confirmed:
Order moves to In Production
Delivery timeline begins

Creator can:
Film according to the approved script
Ask clarification questions
Upload drafts or finals as required

They cannot:
Be asked to expand scope
Be asked to rewrite the script without a paid amendment

The boundaries are clear.

⸻

11. Submission

Creator submits final deliverables.

They see:
Revision allowance remaining
Expected review window
Auto-approval conditions

No guessing games.

⸻

12. Revisions (if requested)

If revisions are requested:
They are clearly scoped
They are tracked
They reduce the remaining revision count

Creators can complete revisions confidently knowing:
They are in-scope
They are protected

⸻

13. Approval and payout

Once the brand approves:
Funds are released from escrow
Platform commission is deducted
Net payout appears in creator wallet

Creators can withdraw immediately or batch payouts.

If the brand does not respond:
Auto-approval triggers
Creator is paid automatically

No chasing. Ever.

⸻

14. Trust progression and rewards

After completion:

Experience level progresses
Relevant badges may be unlocked

This improves:
Future matching
Auto-accept eligibility
Access to higher-value briefs

Good behaviour compounds.

⸻

15. Reviews and history

Creator can leave a review for the brand.

This contributes to:
Brand integrity score
Future creator protection

Creators build a visible history of:
Completed jobs
Approval rates
Professionalism

⸻

16. Repeat work (where it shines)

Creators return to their dashboard.

They now have:
Saved brands
Repeat clients
Higher trust
Faster starts via auto-accept

Each job requires less admin than the last.

⸻

Creator flow in one sentence

Create profile → see only ready briefs → accept protected work → execute clearly → get paid automatically → trust compounds.

⸻
